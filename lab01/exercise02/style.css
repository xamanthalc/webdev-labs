I have been trying to style the cards. I have even used google dev tools (https://help.adthrive.com/hc/en-us/articles/360050316972-How-do-I-see-what-my-website-looks-like-on-different-devices-)
to see how the cards would look in different devices,
but I have not been able to make the layouts. 
*/

/*
Add some style blocks below this line to style the cards.
Feel free to borrow from Exercise 1.
